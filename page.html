  <h1>How long will it take to see a PDF of my customized invitation?</h1>
  <p>If you order a Standard Package of the collection of your choice, you can see a proof in 1 – 2 business days. If you order an Extended Package, it will take longer, 3 – 5 days. This is mainly because it includes more unique items, like the map which require more care to create.</p>

  <h1>How should I send you the details of my event?</h1>
  <p>After you place an order through Etsy, I will start a conversation with you and send you a form that is customized to the collection you chose so I can easily transfer your info into the layout. If you need to add more or make it a little different, there will be a space in the form to send me those ideas too, and we can make it work!</p> 
  
  <h1>Do you offer printed wedding invitations that I can receive in the mail?</h1>
  
  <p>Currently printing services are not available for wedding invitation collections, but feel free to contact me to see if I have the time and resources to help. Occasionally I do and will provide you with an estimate for your project.</p>
  
  <p>If not, I’d still like to help by offering a color match page and materials list to guide you through the process. Read the Printing Glossary and Planning Questions guides for more help.</p>
